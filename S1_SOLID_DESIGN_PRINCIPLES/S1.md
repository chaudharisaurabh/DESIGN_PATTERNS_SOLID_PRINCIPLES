# SOLID Design Principles

[back](../Notes.md)


SOLID is an acronym 

## Introduction

###### S: Single Responsibilty Principle
###### O: Open closed Principle
###### L: Liskov Subsituition Principle
###### I: Interface Segregation Principle
###### D: Dependency Inversion Principle


## Single Responsibilty Principle

It tells us that there should be never more than one reason for class to change.\
A class offers a focused functionality, single functionality or addresses a specific concern.

The principle says that if we have three different responsibilities then we should have 3 different classes to handle this responsibilities.


## Open closed Principle

Software entities (Classess, modules, methods etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

Open for Extension : Extend existing behaviour
Closed for modification : Existing code remains unchanged.

## Liskov Substituition Principle

We should be able to substitute base class object with thr child class object and this should not alter the behaviour/characteristics of program.



## Interface Segregation Principle

Clients should not be forced to depend upon Interfaces that they do not use.

Interface pollution

#### Signs of Interface pollution
1. Classes have empty method implementations
2. Methods implementations throw unsupportedOPerationException (or similar)
3. Method implementations return null or default/dummy values.

Wite higly cohesive Interfaces


## Dependency Inversion priciple

A. HighLevel modules should not depend upon low level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend upon details, details should depend upon abstractions.
